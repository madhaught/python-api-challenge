# python-api-challenge
This is the repository for the edX Data Visualization bootcamp affiliated with Case Western Reserve University. This is the module 6 hw assignment using python to search API data. There are two parts of this assignment. All of the files for this assignment are found in the folder WeatherPy.

Using the provided starter code, I created the files VacationPy.ipynb and WeatherPy.ipynb. WeatherPy.ipynb contains the first part of the assignment. In that file, I searched OpenWeather API and created visualizations of the relationships between latitude and different aspects of weather such as temperature and humidity. The visualizations are saved as figures in the folder output_data along with a csv with my saved search results from the API.

In the VacationPy.ipynb section of this assignment, I narrowed down the cities in the csv I created in WeatherPy.ipynb to only cities without cloudiness. I then search the Geoapify places API for the nearest hotel in those cities and created a map to display this data.
